# Online Polling - sem4 Project

<br>

I have created a web-based polling application using Python and the Django framework. <br>
This project allows users to vote on various topics or questions.
The application is hosted on my local server and utilizes HTML templates found on the internet to create a user-friendly interface. Additionally, it employs an SQLite database to store polling data.

### Key Components:

1.Django Framework:

-The Django framework is the backbone of this project, providing tools and libraries for web development. <br>
-It manages URL routing, user authentication, and the overall structure of the web application.

2.Polling Functionality:

-Users can view a list of topics or questions to vote on. <br>
-They can select their preferred option and submit their vote. <br>
-The application records and stores votes in the database.

3.HTML Templates:

-To create the user interface, I used existing HTML templates sourced from the internet. <br>
-These templates were customized to fit the project's specific requirements, saving development time.

4.SQLite Database:

-The project uses an SQLite database to store polling data. <br>
-SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database engine that's suitable for development and prototyping.

5.Local Server Hosting:

-The web application is hosted on my local server, allowing me to test and develop it in a controlled environment <br>
-This setup is ideal for debugging and fine-tuning the application.
